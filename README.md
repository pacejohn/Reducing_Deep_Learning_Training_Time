# Reducing Deep Learning Training Time

In my blog (xxx), I showed how much deep learning training time could be reduced by using enterprise level servers rather than laptops or workstations.  Here, I show the specs of the 2 servers (S1 and S2) and workstation (WS) used in the comparisons.  I also list the actual training times each BERT model for 1 epoch.
